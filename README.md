# Native-Armor-Expansion-Bladenet-Mod

a Multiplayer mod for Warband Native,it adds additional armors for players if they have the mod 
downloaded(it also needs to be on the server),it can easily be integrated into your existing 
module by simply following the Readme files in the root folder,this mod was used on the
**High_Money_Siege** Server,the server however used a outdated version and version 2 of the mod was never on any
public server.

It adds many more items for players and keeps compaitibilty with native,allowing users who don't have the mod installed
to also play on the server with the mod.It also reorginises the equipment UI when a player is on the selection screen 
on the server and adds loads of custom armors which aren't availble in the current version of NeoGk.
