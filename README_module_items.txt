The entire module_items.py is now documented,
items which are used in sp but aren't used in mp are 
tagged with #Open [Element(elements can be found after
the turotial code)] 
#Closed [Element] are slots which are used for custom
armors for the BNEM mod
#mp mod tag is used for items which have been
ported from singleplayer into multiplayer
#Native MP tag is used for items which 
already occupy native MP slots
